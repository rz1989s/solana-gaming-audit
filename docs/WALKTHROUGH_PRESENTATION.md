## ❓ SECTION 5: Q&A & TECHNICAL DISCUSSION (10 MINUTES)

### **Anticipated Questions & Responses**

#### **Q: "How confident are you in the VUL-096 finding?"**
**A:** *"Absolutely certain. We have working exploit code that demonstrates complete protocol compromise. The private keys are hardcoded in lines 15-17 of src/lib.rs. This is a definitive finding requiring immediate action."*

#### **Q: "What's the timeline for implementing fixes?"**
**A:** *"We recommend a phased approach: Emergency fixes for VUL-096 and critical issues within 7 days, core security implementation over 30 days, and advanced hardening over 90 days. We've provided complete remediation code for all findings."*

#### **Q: "How does this compare to other Solana audit reports?"**
**A:** *"This represents 4-8x more vulnerabilities than typical audits, with 100% proof-of-concept coverage. Our multi-agent methodology and economic analysis are industry-leading innovations."*

#### **Q: "Can you help with implementation?"**
**A:** *"Absolutely. We're available for ongoing security partnership, implementation guidance, and long-term protocol hardening. Our goal is your successful and secure launch."*

#### **Q: "What about false positives in your findings?"**
