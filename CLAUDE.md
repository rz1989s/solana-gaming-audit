# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a **security audit project** for a Solana-based competitive FPS gaming protocol with Win-2-Earn mechanics. Players stake tokens before matches, and winners take all escrowed funds. The audit focuses on fund security, game logic integrity, and anti-abuse systems.

**Critical Context**: This is NOT a traditional development project - it's a security bounty submission for PrimeSkill Studio with a deadline of September 26, 2025.

### Core Components (Based on Protocol Analysis)

**Critical Security Areas**:
1. **Escrow System** - Fund locking/release mechanism (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
2. **Winner Determination** - Game result validation and payout logic
3. **Anti-Abuse Mechanics** - Fraud prevention and fair play enforcement
4. **Access Control** - Solana account ownership and PDA security

## Working with This Codebase

### Security Audit Workflow
1. **Static Analysis**: Review smart contract code for vulnerability patterns
2. **Dynamic Testing**: Develop attack simulations and edge case tests
3. **Documentation**: Create professional audit reports with severity ratings
4. **Improvements**: Implement security fixes and optimizations

### Key Security Patterns to Check
- **Re-entrancy Protection**: Cross-program invocation safety
- **Access Control**: Proper signer verification and account ownership
- **Integer Overflow/Underflow**: Safe arithmetic in stake calculations
- **PDA Security**: Correct Program Derived Address usage
- **Race Conditions**: Concurrent operation safety
- **Economic Attacks**: Flash loan and manipulation resistance

### Solana-Specific Considerations
- **Account Validation**: Verify account ownership before operations
- **Compute Budget**: Optimize for gas efficiency and prevent DoS
- **Cross-Program Invocation**: Safe inter-program communication
- **Account Size Limits**: Manage data storage constraints
- **Clock/Slot Usage**: Proper timing and randomness handling

## Development Environment

### Required Tools
- **Rust**: Smart contract language
- **Solana CLI**: Blockchain interaction
- **Anchor Framework**: Development framework (if used)
- **VS Code**: Recommended IDE with Rust extension

### Testing Environment
```bash
# Local development
solana config set --url localhost
solana-test-validator

# Devnet testing
solana config set --url devnet

# Check current configuration
solana config get
```
