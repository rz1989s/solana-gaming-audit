## 🔢 Vulnerability Numbering System

- **Format**: `VUL-XXX-short-description.md`
- **Sequential numbering**: VUL-001, VUL-002, VUL-003, etc.
- **Severity folder**: Placed in appropriate severity directory
- **Consistent naming**: Short, descriptive names in kebab-case

## 📊 Severity Classification (CVSS v3.1)

### 🚨 Critical (9.0-10.0)
- Fund drainage/theft
- Complete access control bypass
- Protocol shutdown capabilities
- **Priority**: Immediate fix required

### ⚠️ High (7.0-8.9)
- Economic manipulation
- Game logic exploitation
- Partial access control bypass
- **Priority**: Fix within 1-2 days

### ⚡ Medium (4.0-6.9)
- Logic flaws with limited impact
- DoS vulnerabilities
- Information disclosure
- **Priority**: Fix within 1 week

### 💡 Low (0.1-3.9)
- Gas optimization issues
- Minor logic inconsistencies
- Code quality improvements
- **Priority**: Fix when convenient

### ℹ️ Informational
- Best practice recommendations
- Documentation improvements
- Code style suggestions
- **Priority**: Non-critical improvements

## 📝 Vulnerability Report Template

Each vulnerability document must include:

1. **Metadata**
   - Vulnerability ID
   - CVSS Score & Vector
   - Discovery Date
   - Status (New/Confirmed/Fixed/Closed)

2. **Technical Details**
   - Affected Function/File
   - Root Cause Analysis
   - Attack Vector Description
   - Proof of Concept Code

3. **Impact Assessment**
   - Financial Impact
   - User Impact
   - Protocol Impact
   - Exploitability Analysis

4. **Remediation**
   - Recommended Fix
   - Code Patches
   - Testing Requirements
   - Verification Steps

5. **References**
   - Related Issues
   - External References
   - Test Cases

## 📈 Current Status

### Critical Vulnerabilities
- **VUL-001**: Fund Drainage in Team Games (CVSS 9.8) - ✅ Identified

### High Vulnerabilities
- *Pending analysis...*

### Medium Vulnerabilities
- *Pending analysis...*

### Low Vulnerabilities
- *Pending analysis...*

### Informational
- *Pending analysis...*

## 🔄 Workflow

1. **Discovery**: Identify vulnerability during audit
2. **Documentation**: Create detailed report using template
3. **Classification**: Assign CVSS score and severity
4. **Validation**: Verify vulnerability and impact
5. **Remediation**: Develop and test fix
6. **Verification**: Confirm fix resolves issue
7. **Closure**: Mark as resolved and test
