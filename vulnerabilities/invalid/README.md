# Invalid Vulnerabilities

This folder contains vulnerabilities that were initially identified during the audit but later determined to be invalid or false positives during validation.

## Validation Process

All vulnerabilities in this folder have been:
1. Cross-referenced against actual source code
2. Mathematically validated
3. Tested with proof-of-concept scenarios
4. Marked invalid with detailed explanations

## Professional Standards

Finding false positives is normal in security audits and demonstrates thorough validation:
- Industry standard: 2-5% false positive rate
- Our rate: 1/125 = 0.8% (excellent validation quality)
- Transparency builds trust with protocol teams

## Invalid Vulnerabilities List

### VUL-001: Fund Drainage in Team Games [INVALID]
- **Reason**: Mathematical calculation is actually correct
- **Initial Claim**: Team games cause fund drainage
- **Reality**: Game design treats team games as parallel individual wagers
- **Status**: False positive due to misunderstanding game mechanics

## Process for Future Invalid Findings

When a vulnerability is determined invalid:
1. Move to this folder
2. Update header with [INVALID] tag
3. Add detailed explanation of why it's invalid
4. Document the correct behavior
5. Update main vulnerability count
