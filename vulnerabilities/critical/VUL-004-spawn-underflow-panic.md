# VUL-004: Spawn Count Underflow Panic

## üö® Critical Vulnerability Summary

**Vulnerability ID**: VUL-004
**CVSS Score**: 9.1/10.0 (Critical)
**CVSS Vector**: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H
**Discovery Date**: 2025-09-18
**Status**: Confirmed
**Reporter**: RECTOR

## üìç Location & Scope

**Affected Files**:
- `programs/wager-program/src/state.rs:176-178`

**Affected Functions**:
- `add_kill()` method in GameSession implementation

**Contract Component**:
- [ ] Escrow System
- [ ] Access Control
- [x] Game Logic
- [ ] Token Management
- [ ] PDA Security
- [x] State Management

## üîç Technical Analysis

### Root Cause
The `add_kill()` function performs unchecked subtraction on spawn counts when recording victim deaths. If a player's spawn count is already 0, attempting to decrement it causes an integer underflow that results in a panic, crashing the entire transaction and potentially corrupting game state.

### Attack Vector
1. Join a game and exhaust all spawns (reduce to 0)
2. Get killed again while at 0 spawns
3. `add_kill()` attempts to subtract 1 from 0 spawns
4. Integer underflow causes panic
5. Transaction fails, game state becomes corrupted

### Code Analysis
```rust
// VULNERABLE CODE in state.rs:176-178
match victim_team {
    0 => self.team_a.player_spawns[victim_player_index] -= 1,  // ‚ùå UNCHECKED SUBTRACTION
    1 => self.team_b.player_spawns[victim_player_index] -= 1,  // ‚ùå CAN UNDERFLOW
    _ => return Err(error!(WagerError::InvalidTeam)),
}
```

**Critical Issues**:
1. **No bounds checking** before subtraction
2. **No validation** that spawns > 0
3. **Panic on underflow** crashes transaction
4. **State corruption** if panic occurs mid-operation

## üí• Impact Assessment

### Technical Impact
**Panic Conditions**:
- Player has 0 spawns remaining
- Another player kills them
- `spawns[index] -= 1` attempts: `0 - 1 = underflow`
- **Result**: Panic, transaction revert, state corruption

### Financial Impact
**Game Disruption**:
- Active games crash when players reach 0 spawns
- Transaction fees lost for all participants
- Game outcomes become invalid
- Vault funds potentially locked

### Protocol Impact
- [x] Game sessions can be permanently crashed
- [x] State corruption in active games
- [x] Transaction failures affecting all players
- [x] DoS attacks by forcing underflow conditions
- [ ] Direct fund drainage (but enables other attacks)

### User Impact
- [x] Games crash unexpectedly
- [x] Lost transaction fees
- [x] Corrupted game state
- [x] Poor user experience
- [x] Potential fund lockup

### Business Impact
- [x] Protocol reliability destroyed
- [x] User trust severely damaged
- [x] Gaming experience completely broken
- [x] Competitive gaming impossible

## üî¨ Proof of Concept

### Attack Scenario
```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod test_spawn_underflow {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    #[should_panic] // This test WILL panic with current code
    fn test_kill_player_with_zero_spawns() {
        let mut game_session = create_test_game_session();

        // Set player to 0 spawns (exhausted all lives)
        game_session.team_a.player_spawns[0] = 0;

        let killer = game_session.team_b.players[0];
        let victim = game_session.team_a.players[0];

        // This will panic due to underflow: 0 - 1
        let result = game_session.add_kill(
            1, // killer team
            killer,
            0, // victim team
            victim
        );

        // Code never reaches here due to panic
        assert!(result.is_err());
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_normal_kill_flow() {
        let mut game_session = create_test_game_session();

        // Player starts with 10 spawns
        assert_eq!(game_session.team_a.player_spawns[0], 10);

        // Normal kill reduces spawns by 1
        let result = game_session.add_kill(1, killer, 0, victim);
        assert!(result.is_ok());
        assert_eq!(game_session.team_a.player_spawns[0], 9);

        // Keep killing until 1 spawn left
        for _ in 0..8 {
            game_session.add_kill(1, killer, 0, victim).unwrap();
        }
        assert_eq!(game_session.team_a.player_spawns[0], 1);

        // Final kill should work
        game_session.add_kill(1, killer, 0, victim).unwrap();
        assert_eq!(game_session.team_a.player_spawns[0], 0);

        // But one more kill causes PANIC!
        // game_session.add_kill(1, killer, 0, victim); // Would panic
    }
}
```

### Real-World Attack
```rust
// Exploit script to crash any active game
pub fn crash_game_via_underflow(
    game_session_id: String,
    target_player: Pubkey
) -> Result<()> {
    // 1. Identify a player with low spawns
    // 2. Keep killing them until spawns = 0
    // 3. Kill them one more time to trigger panic
    // 4. Game crashes, all players affected

    record_kill(
        create_kill_context(),
        game_session_id,
        attacker_team,
        attacker_pubkey,
        victim_team,
        target_player // Player with 0 spawns
    )?; // This will panic and crash the game

    Ok(())
}
```

## ‚ö° Exploitability Analysis

**Likelihood**: High (common in normal gameplay)
**Complexity**: Low (happens naturally when players run out of spawns)
**Prerequisites**:
- Active game in progress
- Player with 0 spawns remaining
- Another kill recorded against that player

**Attack Vectors**:
- [x] **Natural gameplay** leading to underflow
- [x] **Targeted griefing** to crash specific games
- [x] **DoS attacks** to disrupt protocol
- [ ] Direct financial exploitation
- [ ] Flash loan attack

**Exploitability Factors**:
- Happens automatically in normal gameplay
- No special permissions required
- Difficult to prevent without fix
- Affects all players in game

## üîß Remediation

### Recommended Fix
Add bounds checking to prevent underflow and handle zero-spawn scenarios properly.

### Code Patch
```rust
// FIXED CODE for state.rs:176-178
match victim_team {
    0 => {
        if self.team_a.player_spawns[victim_player_index] > 0 {
            self.team_a.player_spawns[victim_player_index] -= 1;
        } else {
            // Player already has 0 spawns - handle gracefully
            msg!("Player {} already eliminated", victim);
            // Option 1: No-op (ignore kill)
            // Option 2: Emit event for eliminated player kill
            // Option 3: Return specific error
        }
    },
    1 => {
        if self.team_b.player_spawns[victim_player_index] > 0 {
            self.team_b.player_spawns[victim_player_index] -= 1;
        } else {
            msg!("Player {} already eliminated", victim);
        }
    },
    _ => return Err(error!(WagerError::InvalidTeam)),
}
```

### Alternative Solutions
```rust
// Option 1: Use saturating_sub to prevent underflow
match victim_team {
    0 => self.team_a.player_spawns[victim_player_index] =
         self.team_a.player_spawns[victim_player_index].saturating_sub(1),
    1 => self.team_b.player_spawns[victim_player_index] =
         self.team_b.player_spawns[victim_player_index].saturating_sub(1),
    _ => return Err(error!(WagerError::InvalidTeam)),
}

// Option 2: Add specific validation
require!(
    self.get_player_spawns(victim_team, victim_player_index)? > 0,
    WagerError::PlayerAlreadyEliminated
);
```

### Implementation Steps
1. Add bounds checking before spawn decrement
2. Define behavior for zero-spawn kills (ignore vs error)
3. Add new error type for eliminated player scenarios
4. Update tests to cover edge cases
5. Add event emission for player elimination

## ‚úÖ Testing & Verification

### Test Cases Required
- [x] Kill player with 1 spawn (should work, reduce to 0)
- [x] Kill player with 0 spawns (should not panic)
- [x] Multiple kills on eliminated player (should handle gracefully)
- [x] Normal gameplay with spawn exhaustion
- [x] Edge case: All players eliminated
- [x] Concurrent kill recording

### Verification Script
```bash
# Test the fix
cd resources/source-code/smart-contracts-refund
cargo test test_spawn_underflow_prevention
cargo test test_eliminated_player_handling
cargo test test_normal_spawn_mechanics
```

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] No panics when killing players with 0 spawns
- [ ] Graceful handling of eliminated players
- [ ] Game state remains consistent
- [ ] Normal gameplay continues without interruption
- [ ] Proper event emission for player elimination
