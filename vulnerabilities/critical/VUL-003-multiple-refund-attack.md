- `refund_wager_handler()`

**Contract Component**:
- [x] Escrow System
- [ ] Access Control
- [x] Game Logic
- [x] Token Management
- [ ] PDA Security

## üîç Technical Analysis

### Root Cause
The `refund_wager` function lacks proper state validation before processing refunds. It does not check if the game is in an appropriate state for refunds, allowing players to claim refunds from active or already completed games where refunds should not be permitted.

### Attack Vector
1. Join a game session and deposit funds normally
2. Wait for game to start (status becomes `InProgress`)
3. Call `refund_wager` while game is active
4. Receive full refund while still participating in active game
5. Continue playing with "free" participation
6. Potentially win additional funds on top of refund

### Code Analysis
```rust
// VULNERABLE CODE in refund_wager.rs:6-94
pub fn refund_wager_handler<'info>(
    ctx: Context<'_, '_, 'info, 'info, RefundWager<'info>>,
    session_id: String,
) -> Result<()> {
    let game_session = &ctx.accounts.game_session;
    msg!("Starting Refund for session: {}", session_id);

    // ‚ùå NO STATUS CHECK! Should verify game is refundable
    let players = game_session.get_all_players();

    // ‚ùå PROCESSES REFUND WITHOUT VALIDATION
    for player in players {
        if player == Pubkey::default() {
            continue;
        }
        let refund = game_session.session_bet;
        // ... transfers refund ...
    }

    // ‚ùå SETS STATUS TO COMPLETED REGARDLESS OF PREVIOUS STATE
    let game_session = &mut ctx.accounts.game_session;
    game_session.status = GameStatus::Completed;

    Ok(())
}
```

**Missing Validations**:
1. No check if game status allows refunds
2. No verification that game hasn't started
3. No check if game is already completed
4. No verification that players are eligible for refunds

## üí• Impact Assessment

### Financial Impact
**Attack Scenario Example**:
- Game session bet: 1,000 tokens per player
- 10 players join (10,000 tokens in vault)
- Game starts (status = InProgress)
- Attacker calls refund_wager
- All 10 players get refunded 1,000 tokens each
- **Total loss: 10,000 tokens drained from active game**

**Economic Impact**:
- Players get "free" game participation
- Active games can be drained of all funds
- Winners of drained games receive nothing
- Protocol becomes insolvent

### Protocol Impact
- [x] Complete fund drainage from active games
- [x] Game state corruption (active ‚Üí completed)
- [x] Winners of legitimate games lose rewards
- [x] Protocol economic model destroyed
- [ ] Protocol shutdown capability

### User Impact
- [x] Legitimate players lose deposited funds
- [x] Game outcomes become meaningless
- [x] Active gameplay interrupted
- [x] Trust in protocol destroyed

### Business Impact
- [x] Immediate financial losses
- [x] Protocol reputation damage
- [x] User fund security compromised
- [x] Business model unsustainable

## üî¨ Proof of Concept

### Attack Scenario
1. **Setup**: Create game session with 1,000 token bet per player
2. **Join**: 5 players join each team (10,000 tokens total)
3. **Start**: Game begins normally (status = InProgress)
4. **Attack**: Call refund_wager function
5. **Result**: All 10,000 tokens refunded, game marked completed
6. **Impact**: Active game drained, legitimate winners get nothing

### Test Code
```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod test_multiple_refund_attack {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_refund_active_game() {
        // Create active game session
        let mut game_session = create_test_game_session(1000);
        game_session.status = GameStatus::InProgress; // Game is active

        // Vault contains player deposits
        let initial_vault_balance = 10000;

        // Attacker calls refund while game is active
        let result = refund_wager_handler(
            create_refund_context(game_session, initial_vault_balance),
            "test_session".to_string()
        );

        // Refund succeeds despite game being active!
        assert!(result.is_ok());

        // All funds are drained from active game
        assert_eq!(vault_balance_after, 0);

        // Game is marked completed prematurely
        assert_eq!(game_session.status, GameStatus::Completed);
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_double_refund() {
        // Already completed game with refunds processed
        let mut game_session = create_test_game_session(1000);
        game_session.status = GameStatus::Completed;

        // Try to refund again
        let result = refund_wager_handler(
            create_refund_context(game_session, 0), // Vault already empty
            "test_session".to_string()
        );

        // Should fail but might not due to missing validation!
        // This could cause underflow or panic
    }
}
```

### Expected vs Actual Behavior
- **Expected**: Refunds only allowed for cancelled/failed games
- **Actual**: Refunds processed for any game state
- **Expected**: Game state preserved during invalid refund attempts
- **Actual**: Game state always changed to Completed

## ‚ö° Exploitability Analysis

**Likelihood**: High (function publicly accessible)
**Complexity**: Low (single function call)
**Prerequisites**:
- Access to any game session ID
- Authority permissions to call refund function
- Basic understanding of the refund mechanism

**Attack Vectors**:
- [x] Direct refund call on active games
- [x] Double refund on completed games
- [x] Refund griefing (drain opponent's active game)
- [x] Economic denial of service
- [ ] Flash loan attack
- [ ] MEV exploitation

## üîß Remediation

### Recommended Fix
Add proper state validation to ensure refunds are only processed for appropriate game states.

### Code Patch
```rust
// FIXED CODE for refund_wager.rs
pub fn refund_wager_handler<'info>(
    ctx: Context<'_, '_, 'info, 'info, RefundWager<'info>>,
    session_id: String,
) -> Result<()> {
    let game_session = &ctx.accounts.game_session;
    msg!("Starting Refund for session: {}", session_id);

    // ‚úÖ ADD PROPER STATE VALIDATION
    require!(
        game_session.status == GameStatus::WaitingForPlayers,
        WagerError::InvalidGameStateForRefund
    );

    // ‚úÖ ADD TIME-BASED VALIDATION (OPTIONAL)
    let clock = Clock::get()?;
    let max_wait_time = 3600; // 1 hour max wait
    require!(
        clock.unix_timestamp - game_session.created_at > max_wait_time,
        WagerError::RefundTooEarly
    );

    // ‚úÖ VERIFY GAME NOT FULLY FILLED
    require!(
        !game_session.check_all_filled()?,
        WagerError::CannotRefundFullGame
    );

    let players = game_session.get_all_players();

    for player in players {
        if player == Pubkey::default() {
            continue;
        }

        let refund = game_session.session_bet;

        // ... existing refund logic ...
    }

    // ‚úÖ SET APPROPRIATE STATUS
    let game_session = &mut ctx.accounts.game_session;
    game_session.status = GameStatus::Completed; // or add new Refunded status

    Ok(())
}
```

### Implementation Steps
1. Add new error types for invalid refund states
2. Implement state validation at function start
3. Add time-based refund eligibility checks
4. Consider adding new `Refunded` status to distinguish from normal completion
5. Update access control to prevent unauthorized refunds

### Additional Security Measures
- Add event emission for refund tracking
- Implement refund cooldown periods
- Add multi-signature requirement for refunds
- Consider implementing partial refunds based on game progress

## ‚úÖ Testing & Verification

### Test Cases Required
- [x] Refund fails for InProgress games
- [x] Refund fails for Completed games
- [x] Refund succeeds only for WaitingForPlayers with timeout
- [x] Double refund attempts fail
- [x] Unauthorized refund attempts fail
- [x] Partial team refunds work correctly
- [x] State transitions are correct after refund

### Verification Script
```bash
# Commands to verify the fix
cd resources/source-code/smart-contracts-refund
cargo test test_refund_state_validation
cargo test test_refund_timing_validation
cargo test test_double_refund_prevention
```

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Refunds only processed for valid states
- [ ] Active games cannot be refunded
- [ ] Completed games cannot be refunded
- [ ] Proper error messages for invalid refund attempts
- [ ] Game state preserved during failed refund attempts
